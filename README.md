Husky 100 Directory Plugin for WordPress
=====================================

This plugin adds a custom content type for students of the husky 100, an associated template, and a directory template. A page that uses the directory template is created if draft form. The single Student post type pages are not publicly visible by default, but there is a setting to turn that on. People are grouped into teams (custom taxonomy) in the directory template, with options to put a team at the top and specific people at the top of teams. Includes livesearch.js which does on-page filtering of students when users type in the provided search box. Requires UW 2014 theme.
